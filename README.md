# microservices
A set of regular microservices for practice and reference.

# List of microservices to implement


### Status

- `Not started yet`: no code base created
- `Initialized`: setup code base with default router, few lines of doc
- `Implementing`: working on the functions
- `Basic implementation`: main function works, but incomplete
- `Done`: finish main function, standardize data format, fully tested

# Contributions

If you would like to learn more about micro services, or a new programming language, or one of the above tech stacks, feel free to contribute.



To keep things consistent for others, please refer the next section.


# Rules and standards

### Naming convention

Each of service should be stored within a separate folder. These folders must be named in dash-case style by the format of {SERVICE NAME}-{LANGUAGE}, for examples:

- `article-parser-node`
- `video-store-deno`
- `feed-parser-py`
- `email-sender-go`
- `notification-pusher-v`

### Service.json file

Each of service must have a `service.json` file to declare name, version and some basic configs.


```json
{
  "name": "Feed Parser service in Go",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 7454
}
```

These values should be used to introduce the service at its starting time:

### Dockerfile & docker-compose.yaml

All services must be able to containerized.

The images should be carefully selected. Good to use the minimal ones, or those are designed for microservice.

The containers should be configured to run within the same virtual network named `micro-net`, so please create it at first.


```bash
docker network create micro-net
```


### Functional Programming

It's recommended to apply Functional Programming style here.


### Coding convention

- Node.js, JavaScript, Deno: [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/)
- Python: PEP8
- Golang: *not defined yet*
- Vlang: *not defined yet*

### Output format

- JSON output format: [jsend](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend) and [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml)
